- **redis** (Automatic setup when using the Railway template) - fallback to simulated redis.

`npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` will start the backend (and admin dashboard frontend on `localhost:9000/app`) in development mode.
`pnpm build && pnpm start` will compile the project and run from compiled source. This can be useful for reproducing issues on your cloud instance.
